\section{Introduction}
Defining good threat models can be very helpful in improving existing systems, or contribute to building better, safer and more fault tolerant systems. Threat models are especially important in Software engineering and Computer Science in general because it is a relatively new field of research and there are not much threat models defined. A threat model can help us to understand how a particular system reacts to a situation that is different from normal operating conditions. The limits that a threat model define makes it easier to discuss and reach conclusions in a defined scenario.

In this paper, the threat models are picked up in that way so they can be used to compare the ability of the centralised and decentralised computer systems to deal with circumstances other than normal. Because centralised and decentralised systems have much broader meaning, the focus is narrowed down to centralised computer networks and decentralised (distributed) computer networks and applications that are dependent on these particular network architecture. To study the characteristics of the centralised computer systems, a well known centralised web applications will be used. 

The most popular applications among the users now are the social networking sites, where the absolute giant between them is Facebook, which has recently passed one billion users \cite{web:facebookpassesbillion}. Other popular social networks are Twitter, Google Plus, MySpace, LinkedIn. Conclusions for decentralised computer systems will be made after observing how threat models affect peer-to-peer networks. The whole set of decentralized networks has been reduced to just peer-to-peer networks, because they have the essential characteristics that are of interest. Also there is whole class of application in between centralised and decentralised model like e-mail, DNS and XMPP that have both centralised and decentralised characteristics. They are not subject of interest in this paper.

According to Internet World Statistics research \cite{web:internetworldstats} the internet penetration percent in the most progressive countries can go even above 60\%. Examples are Northern America (78.6\%), Australia and Oceania (67.5\%) and Europe (61.3\%). Roughly every third person on the planet has access to the Internet, and has power to share information. 

The figures of internet penetration \cite{web:internetworldstats} in human societies, implies that people need this tools even in the most harsh conditions. Especially important are problems which can occur in the infrastructure of the computer systems or threats related to security, with special emphasis on security of the users data. Threat models have been modelled to target both of the mentioned aspects of potential flaws. The most important thing is that this paper does not captures the whole picture of a threat, but rather than that certain characteristics had been taken to model the newly occurred situation.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the Section 2 the methods for research to produce this paper are presented. Every key phrase used in search for relevant references has been given along with the used search engines. Methods for building the models are also presented in this section. Next in the Section 3 there is a short summary of all three threat models, with a depiction of the most important features (conditions). In the Sections 4, 5 and 6 respectively, the previously defined threat models has been applied on both types of network architecture. By giving a detailed description of the circumstances the relation with a particular threat model can be seen. Threat models have been applied to both centralized and decentralized systems under the same circumstances. The predicted reaction of the systems under new the new conditions is used in the Section 7 where the conclusion is presented based on the previous findings.

%Fist we explain our methods for gathering our information. We present which databases for paper search are used and the phrases we used to generate search results. Beside this, we explain how we choose out threat models, and how we have modified the according to our needs. Than we give a detail description for every situation that is related to a threat model, and try to study the systems behaviour. On basys of this studies we conclude how good or bad is particular system with dealing that potential threat.
 
%First with our natural disaster threat model, we try to replicate some of the conditions that can occur during the most common natural disaster events -  foods. In this conditions manly the infrastructure is disabled, due to electrical problems of some cable failure. By applying this threat model to both centralised and decentralised networks we can see make assumptions how the systems would react on them. After that we can summarize the results and give a general conclusions which system is better in dealing with this potential threats.

%To see how data present in the computer networks can be compromised we have chosen models that target that specific characteristics. By applying privacy threat model we can assume how vulnerable is  users of centralised and decentralised networks, and in which potential ways it can be exploited. We try to find if there is any specific characteristics in any of the systems that can successfully deal with this threat.

%Our last threat model addresses censorship in computer networks. Consequently the rise of the popularity of some of the applications, there is exponential growth of the data present in the computer networks that is shared between the users. As we all know, users tend not to care too much of what type of data they release into the network, and there must be some mechanisms to protect innocent people from that type of information. But, it has become a common practice for authorities and the governments to use this misbehaviour of the users as an excuse to 	impose censorship over the users data and to limit their freedom of speech. We will apply our threat model to the computer networks and try to find is there any practical solution to this problem.
